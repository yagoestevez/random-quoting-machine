7. On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".
8. When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.
9. My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.
10. I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in it's href attribute to tweet the current quote.
11. The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
